## Publication Steps

### 1. Update Repository URLs

Replace `yourusername` in these files with your actual GitHub username:

```bash
# Files to update:
- package.json (repository.url, bugs.url, homepage)
- README.md (clone URL, badges)
```

### 2. Final Git Cleanup

```bash
# Ensure you're on main branch
git checkout main

# Check git status
git status

# Review what will be committed
git diff

# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit with meaningful message
git commit -m "chore: prepare for open source release

- Add comprehensive documentation (README, SETUP, CONTRIBUTING)
- Add LICENSE (MIT)
- Add GitHub issue/PR templates
- Add CODE_OF_CONDUCT
- Clean up temporary files
- Update package.json metadata
- Add .env.example files
"
```

### 3. Create GitHub Repository

```bash
# On GitHub, create a new repository named 'procheck'
# Then push your code:

git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/procheck.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 4. Configure Repository Settings

On GitHub:
1. Go to Settings → General
2. Add description: "AI-powered medical protocol search and checklist generation platform"
3. Add website: Your deployed URL (if any)
4. Add topics: `medical`, `healthcare`, `ai`, `elasticsearch`, `gemini`, `react`, `typescript`, `fastapi`
5. Enable "Issues"
6. Enable "Discussions" (optional but recommended)

### 5. Set Up Branch Protection

1. Go to Settings → Branches
2. Add rule for `main` branch:
   - Require pull request reviews before merging
   - Require status checks to pass
   - Require branches to be up to date

### 6. Create Initial Release

1. Go to Releases → Create a new release
2. Tag version: `v1.0.0`
3. Release title: `ProCheck v1.0.0 - Initial Release`
4. Description: Highlight key features
5. Publish release

### 7. Post-Publication

- [ ] Share on social media (Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit)
- [ ] Submit to relevant communities (r/opensource, r/programming)
- [ ] Add to awesome lists (awesome-healthcare, awesome-ai)
- [ ] Create demo video/GIF for README
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD (optional)
- [ ] Add badges to README (build status, coverage, etc.)

## Security Reminders

**NEVER commit these files:**
- `.env` (frontend)
- `backend/.env` (backend)
- `backend/cred.json` (Firebase credentials)
- Any files containing API keys or secrets

**If you accidentally commit secrets:**
1. Immediately revoke/regenerate the exposed credentials
2. Use `git filter-branch` or BFG Repo-Cleaner to remove from history
3. Force push the cleaned history
4. Notify users to re-clone the repository

## Optional Enhancements

- [ ] Add GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
- [ ] Add GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment
- [ ] Set up Dependabot for dependency updates
- [ ] Add code coverage reporting (Codecov, Coveralls)
- [ ] Create project website/landing page
- [ ] Add demo deployment link
- [ ] Create video tutorial
- [ ] Add screenshots to README
- [ ] Set up GitHub Sponsors (if accepting donations)
