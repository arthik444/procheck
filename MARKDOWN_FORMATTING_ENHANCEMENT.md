# Markdown Formatting Enhancement

**⚠️ UPDATE (Oct 14, 2025):** Optimized to single-stage AI processing for 50% faster responses.

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Single-Stage AI Processing** (Optimized ⚡)
- ~~**Stage 1**: Generate content answer with citations~~ 
- ~~**Stage 2**: Format the response with proper markdown structure based on question type~~
- **NEW: Single AI call** with enhanced formatting instructions → 50% faster

### 2. **Question-Type Detection & Formatting**

#### **Comparison Questions** (differentiate, compare, vs, between)
```markdown
| Aspect | Option A | Option B |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Feature 1 | Details [1] | Details [2] |
| Feature 2 | Details [3] | Details [4] |

**Key Differences:**
- Difference 1 with citations [5]
- Difference 2 with citations [6]
```

#### **List Questions** (what are, list, types, warning signs)
```markdown
**Main Category:**
- **Item 1**: Description with citations [1]
- **Item 2**: Description with citations [2]
- **Item 3**: Description with citations [3]
```

#### **How-To Questions** (how to...)
```markdown
**Steps:**

1. **Step 1**: Description with citations [1]
2. **Step 2**: Description with citations [2]
3. **Step 3**: Description with citations [3]
```

#### **General Questions**
```markdown
**Main Point**: Brief intro [1]

**Key Information:**
- Point 1 with citations [2]
- Point 2 with citations [3]
```

### 3. **Enhanced Markdown Viewer**

All markdown elements are beautifully styled:

- ✅ **Tables**: Professional styling with dark header, hover effects
- ✅ **Headers** (H1-H4): Proper hierarchy and spacing
- ✅ **Lists**: Bullet and numbered with proper spacing
- ✅ **Bold/Italic**: Medical terms highlighted
- ✅ **Code Blocks**: Inline and block code styling
- ✅ **Blockquotes**: Border-left accent style
- ✅ **Horizontal Rules**: Clean dividers

### 4. **Citation Preservation**

The formatter includes safety checks:
- Tracks citations before and after formatting
- Falls back to original if >20% of citations are lost
- Preserves all [N] citation numbers

### 5. **Libraries Used**

Already installed (no new dependencies needed):
- `react-markdown` (^10.1.0) - Main markdown renderer
- `remark-gfm` (^4.0.1) - GitHub Flavored Markdown (tables, strikethrough, task lists)
- `@tailwindcss/typography` (^0.5.19) - Beautiful typography presets

## 🎯 Backend Implementation

File: `backend/services/gemini_service.py`

### ~~Function: `_format_response_with_markdown()`~~ **DEPRECATED ⚠️**

**Previous Approach (Removed Oct 14)**: Made a second AI call to format responses
- ❌ Double AI request (4-6 seconds total)
- ❌ Token waste (~50% more usage)

### **NEW Approach: Single AI Call** ⚡

**Current Implementation**: Enhanced prompt in `protocol_conversation_chat()`
- ✅ Markdown formatting instructions in initial prompt
- ✅ Single AI call (2-3 seconds total)
- ✅ 50% faster response time

**Example Flow** (Optimized):
```
User asks: "What are the critical warning signs?"
↓
Enhanced prompt includes: "Use **bold** for medical terms, cite as [N]"
↓
AI generates formatted response in one pass:
**Critical Warning Signs:**
- **Chest Discomfort**: Pressure, squeezing, fullness [1]
- **Shortness of Breath**: May occur with or without chest pain [2]
- **Cold Sweat**: Sudden onset, clammy skin [3]
↓
Direct parsing → Display (2-3 seconds total)
```

## 🎨 Frontend Implementation

File: `src/components/MessageContent.tsx`

### Enhanced Table Styling
- **Dark header** (`bg-slate-700 text-white`)
- **Hover effects** (`hover:bg-slate-50`)
- **Responsive** (horizontal scroll on mobile)
- **Shadow and borders** for depth

### Complete Markdown Support
All markdown elements render beautifully with proper spacing, colors, and typography.

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Different Question Types

1. **Comparison**: "What's the difference between mild and severe heart attack symptoms?"
   - Should show a **table** comparing both

2. **List**: "What are the warning signs of a heart attack?"
   - Should show **bulleted list** with bold items

3. **How-To**: "How do I treat a heart attack?"
   - Should show **numbered steps**

4. **General**: "When should I call 911?"
   - Should show structured paragraphs with headers

### Verify Citations
- Check that all [N] citation numbers are preserved
- Click citations to verify they link correctly
- Ensure new sources (hybrid search) show proper citation IDs
