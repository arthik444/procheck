## ✅ What We Just Added

### **1. Search Metadata Display** 🔍

Every assistant response now shows:
- **"Hybrid Search"** badge (gradient teal-to-blue)
- **Number of results** found in database
- **Response time** in milliseconds

**Visual Example:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🩺 ProCheck Protocol Assistant          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ [⚡ Hybrid Search] [🔍 10 results] [⏱ 85ms] │
│                                          │
│ Here's the comprehensive protocol...     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### **2. Enhanced Loading State** ⏳

While searching, users now see:
- **"Hybrid Search Active"** animated badge
- Clear explanation: "Searching with semantic understanding"
- Technical detail: "Using BM25 keyword + vector embeddings"

**Visual Example:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🩺 ProCheck Protocol Assistant          │

## 🚀 Demo Script for Hackathon

### **Show the Search Process**

**Step 1: Type query**
> "Let me search for 'trouble breathing emergency'"

**Step 2: Point out loading state**
> "Notice the 'Hybrid Search Active' badge - this means we're using both keyword matching AND semantic understanding with vector embeddings"

**Step 3: Show results**
> "Here's what makes it powerful - even though I said 'trouble breathing', it found 'Asthma attack emergency' protocols. The semantic search understood the connection!"

**Step 4: Highlight metadata**
> "See these badges? We searched through 10 documents, found relevant results, and it only took 85 milliseconds. That's the power of Elasticsearch + Google Cloud AI working together."

## 🔄 Before vs After

### Before:
```
[Generic loading spinner]
"Analyzing medical guidelines..."

[Results appear with no context]
```

### After:
```
[⚡ Hybrid Search Active] (pulsing badge)
🔍 Searching with semantic understanding...
Using BM25 keyword + vector embeddings

[⚡ Hybrid Search] [🔍 6 results] [⏱ 78ms]
Here's the comprehensive protocol...
```

**Impact**: Users now understand they're getting AI-powered search, not just basic keyword matching!

---

## 🎨 Visual Hierarchy

```
Priority 1: Hybrid Search Badge (most prominent, gradient)
Priority 2: Results Count (secondary badge)
Priority 3: Response Time (tertiary badge)
```

This order emphasizes the **technology** (hybrid search) first, then the **value** (results count).

## 📱 Responsive Design

- Badges wrap on small screens with `flex-wrap`
- Icons scale appropriately (`h-3 w-3`)
- Text remains readable on mobile
- Consistent spacing with `gap-2`
