## **🔥 DEMO SCENARIOS**

### **Scenario 1: Symptom-Based Search**
```
Query: "Patient has chest pain and shortness of breath"
Result: 🔍 SYMPTOM-BASED ANALYSIS
- Intent: symptom_based
- Entities: chest pain(symptom), shortness of breath(symptom)
- Differential Diagnosis: Heart attack (170%), Asthma (150%), Pneumonia (80%)
- Emergency Indicators: Critical conditions flagged
```

### **Scenario 2: Emergency Protocol**
```
Query: "Cardiac arrest emergency protocol"
Result: 🚨 EMERGENCY PROTOCOL
- Intent: emergency
- Safety Alerts: "Emergency protocol - ensure immediate medical attention"
